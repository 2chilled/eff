Extensible effects are an alternative to monad transformers for computing with effects in a functional way.
This library uses a "free-er" monad and an "open-union" of effects to create an "effect stack" as described in
[Oleg Kiselyov's paper](http://okmij.org/ftp/Haskell/extensible/more.pdf).

There are lots of advantages to this approach:

 - operations can be declared as "requiring" an effect, without the need to fix the full stack of effects in advance

 - effects handlers are modular and can be replaced with other implementations as needed (even at runtime)

 - the underlying implementation is performant and stack-safe

 - existing monad datatypes can be integrated to the library

 - it is possible to integrate different effect stacks into one

This is probably very abstract so let's see more precisely what this all means.

### First example

A monadic action is modelled as a value of type `Eff[R, A]` where `R` denotes a set of effects and `A` is the value
returned by the computation, possibly triggering some effects when evaluated.

The effects `R` are modelled by a type-level list of "effect constructors", for example:${snippet{
import cats.data._
import org.specs2.control.eff._
import Effects._
import EvalEffect._

type ReaderInt[X] = Reader[Int, X]
type WriterString[X] = Writer[String, X]

type Stack = ReaderInt |: WriterString |: Eval |: NoEffect
}}
The stack `Stack` above declares 3 effects:

 - a `ReaderInt` effect to access some configuration number of type `Int`

 - a `WriterString` effect to log string messages

 - an `Eval` effect to only compute values on demand (a bit like lazy values)

Before we can use such a stack we need a bit more boilerplate code:${snippet{
/**
 * Those declarations are necessary to guide implicit resolution
 * but they only need to be declared once per stack.
 *
 * Also we need to declare type aliases for ReaderInt and WriterString
 * instead of using Reader[Int, ?] or Writer[String, ?] more directly
 */

implicit def ReaderMember: Member[ReaderInt, Stack] =
  Member.infer

implicit def WriterMember: Member[WriterString, Stack] =
  Member.infer

implicit def EvalMember: Member[Eval, Stack] =
  Member.infer
}}

Now we can write a program with those 3 effects, using the primitive operations provided by `ReaderEffect`, `WriterEffect` and `EvalEffect`:${snippet{
import Eff._
import ReaderEffect._
import WriterEffect._
import cats.syntax.all._

val program: Eff[Stack, Int] = for {
  // get the configuration
  n <- ask

  // log the current configuration value
  _ <- tell("the required power is "+n)

  // compute the nth power of 2
  a <- delay(math.pow(2, n.toDouble).toInt)

  // log the result
  _ <- tell("the result is "+a)
} yield a

// run the action with all the interpreters
// each interpreter running one effect
run(runEval(runWriter(runReader(6)(program))))
}.eval}

As you can see, the effects are being run in the same order as their declaration in the `Stack` type:

 1. the `Reader` effect, needing a value to inject
 2. the `Writer` effect, which logs values
 3. the `Eval` effect to compute the "power of 2 computation"
 4. finally the `NoEffect` effect (provided by the `Eff` object) to get the final value out of `Eff[Stack, Int]`

Now you can learn about ${"other effects" ~/ OutOfTheBox} supported by this library.
