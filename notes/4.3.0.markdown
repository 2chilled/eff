Maintenance version

Improvements

 * do not memoize failed values for tasks, futures and safe effects
 * added a note in the user guide about effects not covered by the `all._` import [#90](https://github.com/atnos-org/eff/issues/90)

Fixes

 * always pass `onNone` action when executing a continuation to make sure `Safe.thenFinally` always executes
 * changed some `Option()` calls to `Some` to preserve user nulls [#91](https://github.com/atnos-org/eff/issues/91)
