API change

 * the `Eff.detach` method now requires a `MonadError` instance to properly trigger with "last" actions

Documentation improvements

 * bring `Translate` docs closer to `Transform` docs
 * changed the smart constructor names for the `KVStore` effect in the tutorial
 * moved imports in the "create effects" section so they appear on the user guide
