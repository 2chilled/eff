Minor (or not so minor) changes

This release introduces several breaking changes and lots of improvements:

 * updated the documentation on the `Async` effect
 * added `Async.asyncFromEither`
 * move the `AsyncTaskInterpreter` for monix to `org.atnos.eff.addon.monix` to mirror the Scalaz one
 * fixed the creation of `ExecutorService`s from an `ExecutionContext`
