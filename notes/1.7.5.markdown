Maintenance version

Improvements:

 * introduced a `MemberIn` typeclass when it is only necessary to require that an effect can be injected in an effect stack
 * added `T |= R` as type alias to `MemberIn[T, R]`
 * added various `X |= R` type aliases for common effects using a `_effect` convention for the name. For example `type _option = Option |= R`    
 * added a way to derive a `MemberIn[V, U]` instance from `Member.Aux[T, R, U]` when there is an implicit `V |= R` in scope.
     This helps with translating "high-level" effects to "low-level" ones (see the page on [implicits](https://atnos-org.github.io/eff/org.atnos.site.Implicits.html) for an example)

Fixes:
   
 * removed the type alias for `Eval` which can clash with `cats.Eval`
