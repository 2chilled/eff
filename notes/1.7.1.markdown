Maintenance version

Improvements:

 * added an `eff-cats-monix` module to provide a `TaskEffect` based on [monix `Task`](https://github.com/monixio/monix)
 * added a `lift` function to `FutureEffect` to insert a `Future` in a stack [#9](https://github.com/atnos-org/eff-cats/pulls/9) (thanks to @pavlosgi)
 * use `Duration` instead of `FiniteDuration` to run a `FutureEffect` [#9](https://github.com/atnos-org/eff-cats/pulls/10) (thanks to @pavlosgi)
 
Fixes:

 * removed the dependency of `eff-cats` on `scalameter` (only used in tests) [#11](https://github.com/atnos-org/eff-cats/pulls/11)
